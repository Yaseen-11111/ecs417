        <h1>Aldershot, My home town</h1>
        <p1>
          Aldershot is a town in Hampshire, England. It lies on heathland in the extreme northeast corner of the county, 31 mi southwest of London. 
          The area is administered by Rushmoor Borough Council. The town has a population of 37,226, while the Aldershot Urban Area, 
          a loose conurbation (which also includes other towns such as Camberley, Farnborough, and Farnham) has a population of 243,344, making it the thirtieth-largest urban area in the UK.

            Prior to 1850, Aldershott was little known. The area was a vast stretch of common land, a lonely wasteland unsuitable for most forms of agriculture with scant population. 
            As it existed at the time of the Domesday Survey in 1086, the extensive settlement of Crondall in the north-east corner of Hampshire was certainly Scandinavian, 
            for among the customs of that great manor, which included Crondall, Yateley, Farnborough, and Aldershot, that of sole inheritance by the eldest daughter in default of sons prevailed, 
            as over a large part of Cumberland, and this is a peculiarly Norse custom.

        <h2>During World Wars</h2>
        <p1>
          In 1914 Aldershot had the largest army camp in the country with 20% of the British Army being based in and around the town. 
          Aldershot was home for two Infantry Divisions and a Cavalry Brigade in addition to large numbers of artillery, engineers, service corps and medical services. 
          At the start of World War I the units based at Aldershot became the 1st Corps of the British Expeditionary Force and soon tens of thousands of new recruits came to the large training centre in the Camp.

          This had a great effect on the civilian town as there was a great shortage of accommodation for the troops and many were billeted in local houses and schools. 
          Aldershot played a vital role in the formation of Kitchener's Army, providing the core of the Army from 1914 onwards as well as treating the wounded brought back from the trenches in France and Flanders. 
          The Cambridge Military Hospital was the first base hospital to receive casualties directly from the Western Front and it was here that plastic surgery was first performed in the British Empire by Captain Gillies (later Sir Harold Gillies).

        <h2>1972 Aldershot Bombing</h2>
        <p2>
            On 22 February 1972, Aldershot experienced the first in a series of mainland IRA attacks.Seven people, six of whom were civilian support staff, 
            including five catering staff and a gardener were killed in a car bomb attack on the 16th Parachute Brigade headquarters mess. A further 19 people were injured. 
            The bombing was claimed by the Official IRA as revenge for the Bloody Sunday massacre. The only army officer killed was Captain Gerry Weston a Catholic British Army chaplain. 
            An area to be developed into a memorial garden was used to mark the 40th anniversary of the bombing in 2012.
        </p2>

            Aldershot is known as the "Home of the British Army", a connection which led to its rapid growth from a small village to a Victorian town.
